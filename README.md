My solutions to the FooBar challenge

The only changes I have made since the challenge is to add method headers.

The first task I did as training at work but it was clear the tasks would quickly become more mathsy than was relavent so I did the rest at home. Because of this the first task (I think it was something about matching elements in two arrays) is on my work PC, hence it's absence.
